Abstract: AVTransport is a new mechanism for multimedia transmission and storage. It covers use cases from sub-frame latency streaming of video and audio over raw wireless links, to long-term archival. Its key design goals are robustness and reliability, and it achieves this through extensive error correction, and state-minimal design. Learning from the limitations of other similar protocols and containers, it has built-in future-proofing and allows extensibility.

# AVTransport protocol # {#avtransport-protocol}

The AVTransport protocol is a new standardized mechanism for multimedia transport and
storage. This protocol aims to be a simple, reliable and robust low-overhead method
that borrows design decisions from other protocols and aims to be generic,
rather than specialized for certain use-cases. With minimal changes, it can be
processed as a stream or saved to a file as an intermediate step or for post-processing.

Rather than just being a new container and protocol filling a niche, this also attempts
to solve issues with current other containers, like timestamp rounding, lack of DTS,
inflexible metadata, inconvenient index positions, lack of context, inextensible formats,
and rigid overseeing organizations.


## Overview ## {#overview}

On a high-level, AVTransport is a packetized wrapper around codec, metadata and
user packets and provides context and error resilience, as well as defining a
standardized way to transmit such data between clients.

AVTransport is based on <b>packets</b>.

As a simple example, a possible structure of packets in a general AVTransport session could be:

<figure id="table-Overview" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#overview">
        <tr>
            <th>Packet type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#session-start-packets]]</td>
            <td>Starts the session with a signature. May be used to identify the stream as an AVTransport session.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#stream-registration-packets]]</td>
            <td>Register a new stream.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#stream-configuration-packets]]</td>
            <td>Configuration data for the new stream.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#video-information-packets]]</td>
            <td>Information about a video stream.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#metadata-packets]]</td>
            <td>Stream or session metadata.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#index-packets]]</td>
            <td>Optional index packets to enable fast seeking.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#stream-data-packets]]</td>
            <td>Stream data packets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#stream-data-segment-packets]]</td>
            <td>Segmented stream data packets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#user-data-packets]]</td>
            <td>Optional user data packets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#end-of-stream-packets]]</td>
            <td>Finalizes a stream or session.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>


## Packet descriptor ## {#packet-descriptor}

Each packet must be prefixed with a 2-bytes <dfn noexport>descriptor</dfn> to identify it.
Below is a table of how they're allocated:

<figure id="table-DescriptorList" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#packet-descriptor" id="descriptors_list">
        <tr>
            <th>Descriptor values</th>
            <th>Packet</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>''0x4156''</td>
            <td>[[#session-start-packets]]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>[[#fec-grouping-packets]]</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

Note: Range ''0x8000'' to ''0x80FF'' is reserved for [[#reverse-signalling]].

Note: The 16-bit descriptor may be split into two sections, a constant upper 8-bits
and variable bottom 8-bits, hence some descriptors are considered a range.

Anything not specified in the table is reserved and must not be used. Future additions
will require a version bump of the protocol.


## Specification conventions ## {#specification-conventions}

Throughout all of this document, bit sequences are always <b>big-endian</b>, and numbers
are always <b>two's complement</b>.

A special notation is used to describe sequences of bits:
 - <code>u(N)</code> : specifies the data that follows is an unsigned integer of ''N'' bits.
 - <code>i(N)</code> : the same, but the data describes a signed integer is signed.
 - <code>b(N)</code> : the data is an opaque sequence of ''N'' bits that clients must not interpret.
 - <code>R(N)</code> : the data is a rational number, with a numerator (''num'') of <code>i(N/2)</code> and following that, a denominator (''den'') of <code>i(N/2)</code>. The denominator must be greater than ''0''.

All packets are at least 36 bytes long (288 bits), and always have an 8 byte
(64 bits) [[#ldpc]] code after the first 28 bytes to verify and correct their data.

Identification of the packet is always possible via the first two bytes
(the [=descriptor=]).

All floating point samples and pixels are always <b>normalized</b> to fit within the
interval <code>[-1.0, 1.0]</code>.

Padding may be present in some packets (<dfn noexport>padding</dfn>). Unless otherwise indicated,
the data in padding must be ''0x0''.

Note: this document is machine-parseable. Each symbol of a packet or enum has an assigned ID of
the form ''descriptor in hex''+''index'', where index is a number starting from 0,
incremented for each element in a structure.


## LDPC ## {#ldpc}

To improve reliability, and make the protocol general-purpose, a small amount of
parity data is added to each header, in the form of [[LDPC]] codes. These codes highly
improve reliability when transmitting over [[#udp-lite-streaming]].

They also help in the event of a file desynchronization or corruption, by being able
to quickly verify whether an arbitrary byte has a valid packet, thus avoiding presentation
of damaged or invalid stream data.

Finally, for long-term archival on tape, or when transmitting over a noisy [[#serial-transmission]] or
radio connection, they help correct bitflips.

Their theory of operation and specifications are detailed in [[#annex-g-ldpc]].

To simplify implementations, two different lengths are used:
 - <dfn noexport>ldpc_288_224</dfn>: specified in [=LDPC(288, 224)=]
 - <dfn noexport>ldpc_2784_2016</dfn>: specified in [=LDPC(2784, 2016)=]

Note: Applying LDPC error correction is optional for receiver implementations.</br>
Senders must implement it.


## Global sequence ## {#global-sequence}

The <dfn noexport>global_seq</dfn> is a <b>32-bit unsigned integer</b>, incremented by ''1'' each time
after a packet has been sent. Once at ''0xffffffff'', it MUST overflow back to ''0x0''.
This overflow MUST be handled by the receiver.

Note: [=global_seq=] should start at ''0x0'', but receivers MUST be prepared for any starting offset.


## Stream ID ## {#stream-id}

<dfn noexport>stream_id</dfn> is a <b>16-bit unsigned integer</b>, uniquely identifying each stream
contained within an [TITLE] stream.

Note: Senders should never reuse [=stream_id=] indices, but receivers should be prepared
to deal with this scenario.


## Timestamps ## {#timestamps}

AVTransport supports high resolution timestamps, with a maximum resolution of
465.66129 <b>picoseconds</b>. Furthermore, the reliability of the timestamps
can be assured through optional [[#jitter-compensation]].

<b>All</b> time-related fields ([=pts=], [=dts=], [=duration=], and [=skip_preroll=])
have a corresponding [=timebase=] field with which to interpret them.

The mathematical expression to calculate the time <code>t</code>, in seconds, of a timestamp
or duration <code>v</code> and a <i>rational</i> timebase <code>b</code> is the following:

<code>t = v * b.num / b.den</code>

Note: All mathematical operations on timestamps should be done in the integer domain,
as floating-point operations may be inaccurate and inconsistent.

The timebase of [[#stream-data-packets]], [[#stream-duration-packets]],
or any other packets with an explicit [=stream_id=] field is given in the
[[#stream-registration-packets]] packets for the appropriate stream.

The time <code>t</code> of a <dfn noexport>pts</dfn> field corresponds to the exact time when a packet must be
instantaneously released from a decoding buffer, and instantaneously presented.

The time <code>t</code> of a <dfn noexport>dts</dfn> field corresponds to the exact time when a packet must be
input into a synchronous 1-in-1-out decoder. The [=dts=] field is defined as part
of the payload when necessary ([[#codec-encapsulation]]).

The time <code>t</code> of a <dfn noexport>duration</dfn> field corresponds to the exact time difference between
two <b>consecutive</b> frames of audio or video. If the field is non-zero, this assertion
MUST hold. If this condition is violated, the behavior is <b>unspecified</b>.


## Subtitle timestamps ## {#subtitle-timestamps}

For subtitle frames, the [=duration=] field's definition is different. It specifies the
time during which the contents of the current packet must be presented.

Unlike video or audio, subtitle packets are allowed to have overlapping timestamps.
This means that players should be simultaneously presenting all subtitles on screen
whose duration indicates that they should be on screen.

For exact information on how this should be done, implementors are invited to view the
specifications of each encapsulated subtitle format.

Additionally, for subtitles, [=duration=] has two special values:
 - [=duration=] equal to zero has the special meaning of <b>clearing</b> all currently presented subtitles, even if their [=duration=] value overlaps with the current [=pts=].
 - [=duration=] of exactly INT64_MIN (-9223372036854775808) has the special meaning of presenting this subtitle <b>until another subtitle packet appears</b>.

Implementations are welcome to normalize subtitle timestamps and remove any occurrences
of the two special values.


### Jitter compensation ### {#jitter-compensation}

Implementations should use the derived [=ts_clock_freq=] field from
[[#time-synchronization-packets]] packets to perform jitter compensation
of stream timestamps.

The [=ts_clock_id=] is a unique 8-bit identifier for the clock.
It allows to associate a clock with a given stream.

The [=ts_clock_id=]of the [[#stream-registration-packets]] packets
is matched up to the [=ts_clock_id=] of [[#time-synchronization-packets]]
packets. If a match is not found, then no processing must be done.

Note: The only valid targets to perform timestamp jitter compensation are
streams with the same timebase, which must be equal to the inverse of [=ts_clock_freq=].
Jitter compensation is otherwise undefined.

As the [=ts_clock_freq=] field defines a strictly monotonic clock signal with a rate of [=ts_clock_freq=],
which atomically increments a counter, [=ts_clock_seq=] on the <b>rising</b> edge of the waveform, this
can be used to compensate the [=pts=], [=dts=] and [=duration=] values of stream packets.

The following is a suggestion for implementations:
 - Initialize a phase-locked loop, with a frequency equal to [=ts_clock_freq=].
 - Initialize a counter, ''local_ts_clock_seq'', to be equal to [=ts_clock_seq=].
 - Increment the ''local_ts_clock_seq'' on the <b>rising</b> edge of the local oscillator's waveform.

On every received packet:
 - Measure the difference ''Δ'' between [=pts=] and ''local_ts_clock_seq''.
 - If ''Δ'' is small, assume [=pts=] has jitter, and replace it with ''local_ts_clock_seq''
 - Otherwise, add ''Δ'' to ''local_ts_clock_seq''.

This is a very simple example which depends on the local receiver oscillator simply being
*more precise* than the transmitter's oscillator.

Note: The way receivers handle jitter is intentionally left undefined. As a recommendation,
implementations <b>should</b> resampple the audio and adjust video frame duration such that
synchronization is maintained. Otherwise, implementations can drop or duplicate frames.


### Negative times ### {#negative-times}

The time <code>t</code> of a [=pts=] may be negative. Packets with a negative timestamps
must be decoded, but not presented.

For audio packets, this corresponds to the internal algorithmic delay between
the first output sample and the correct sample being available.</br>
For audio, the time between <code>t</code> and <code>0</code> may not be a multiple of the
audio data's [=duration=] of a packet. Implementations must nevertheless remove any
decoded samples with a negative time.

Negative [=pts=] values are allowed, and implementations must decode such frames,
however must not present any such frames unless <code>[=pts=] + [=duration=]</code>
is greater than 0, in which case they must present the data required for that duration.<br/>
This enables removal of extra samples added during audio compression, as well
as permitting video segments taken out of context from a stream to bundle
all dependencies (other frames) required for their presentation.


### Epoch definition ### {#epoch-definition}

The <dfn noexport>epoch</dfn> field of [[#time-synchronization-packets]] packets
is an optional field.

If non-zero, it MUST signal the exact time, in nanoseconds, since
00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, according to the transmitter's wall clock time,
<b>of the stream starting</b>. If a start time is not known, it MUST be zero.
Once a stream has started, it MUST NOT be changed.

The user is allowed to handle the field in the following ways:

<figure id="table-EpochOptions" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#epoch-definition">
        <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Use as metadata</td>
            <td>The [=epoch=] field is used to override [[#metadata-packets]] packet's {{date}} field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ignore</td>
            <td>The field is completely ignored.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stream duration</td>
            <td>The field is used to measure the total time the stream has been operational.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stream latency</td>
            <td>The field is used to measure latency.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Synchronization</td>
            <td>The field is used to synchronize several unconnected receivers.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

By default, implementations must use the field as metadata, if present. Otherwise, they should ignore it.

Users are free to use the field to measure the stream duration by converting the ''t'' of the [=pts=]
field of any stream's packet to nanoseconds (multiply by ''1000000000''), rounding it, and subtracting
it from the [=epoch=] time (<code>t - [=epoch=]</code>).

Users are also free to measure the latency in a similar way, by measuring their current wallclock time
''t'', and using <code>Δ = t' - t - epoch</code>. ''Δ'' will be the delay in nanoseconds.

Finally, if <b>explicitly requested</b>, implementations are allowed to <i>delay</i> presentation by interpreting
a negative latency value of ''Δ'' as a delay.

Note: Packets which had a negative timestamp before must still be dropped to permit for correct decoding
and presentation.

Note: The ''stream latency'' and ''synchronization'' actions depend on all devices having accurately synchronized
clocks. This protocol does not guarantee, nor specify this, as this is outside its scope. Users can use the
Network Time Protocol (NTP), specified in [[RFC5905]], or any other protocol to synchronize clocks, or
simply assume all device are already synchronized.


## URI scheme ## {#uri-scheme}

The recommended URI scheme is:

<code><xmp>avt://[<transport>[:<mode>]@]<address>[:<port>][/[<sender_uuid>][#<params>]]</xmp></code>

 - &lt;transport&gt; may be either missing (default: ''udp'') or:
     * ''udp'': for [[#udp-streaming]] streams
     * ''udplite'': for [[#udp-lite-streaming]] streams
     * ''quic'': for [[#quic-streaming]] streams
     * ''file'': for <b>local</b> files
 - &lt;mode&gt; is an optional setting which has different meanings for senders and receivers:
     * Sender:
         - ''active'': the default value. Means to start continuously sending packets to the given address without attempting bidirectional communication.
         - ''passive'' means to wait for receivers to send packets on the given address to begin transmitting back to them.
     * Receiver:
         - ''passive'': the default value. means to listen on the given address for any packets received without attempting to connect and requesting for data.
         - ''active'':means that receivers will actively connect and try to request a stream from the target address.
 - &lt;address&gt; of the remote host, or local host, multicast group, or local file.
 - &lt;port&gt; on which to listen on/transmit to. Only valid for ''udp'', ''udplite'' and ''quic'' protocols. If not specified, port <b>8212</b> shall be the default port.
 - &lt;sender_uuid&gt; is an optional, <b>unique</b>, <b>pre-shared</b> 128-bit UUID ([[RFC4122]]) value.
 - &lt;params&gt; are a &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; pair of settings for the connection, separated by an <code>&</code> sign:
     * default=&lt;stream_id1&gt;,&lt;stream_id2&gt;: Specifies streams to assign as being the default

The syntax complies with [[RFC8820]] and can be parsed by existing code. Implementations are free to extend the syntax.

Note: Alternatively, for UDP-only, the <code>udp://&lt;address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code> URI scheme may be used,
at the risk of conflict with other protocols (''MPEG-TS'' or ''Matroska'').

Note: When handling AVTransport files, it is recommended to use the <b>.avt</b> file extension.
Alternatively, for image-only files, <b>.ati</b> is recommended, and for subtitles,
the recommendation is <b>.avs</b>.


# Packet structure # {#packet-structure}

This section lists the syntax of each individual packet type and specifies its purpose,
and rules about its usage.

Special considerations and suggestions which need to be taken into account in a streaming
scenario are described in the [[#streaming]] section.


## Session start ## {#session-start-packets}

Session start packets allow receivers to plausibly identify a stream of bytes
as an AVTransport session. The syntax is as follows:

<figure id="table-SessionData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#session-start-packets">

        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

Multiple session packets may be present in a session, but must remain
bytewise-identical.

The [=producer_name=] field is a <i>fixed-length</i> string, meaning that
the field is always 16 bytes. If the name is less than 16 bytes, it must
be zero-padded.

[=session_uuid=] is a long-term pre-agreed token between the sender and receiver. It is meant to represent a user ID, or a generic access token. If no pre-agreed token is required, it must contain random data.

[=session_seq=] is an ephemeral ID that is supposed to change each time a transmission is initiated. It is meant to help with longer duration disconnections.

## Stream Session Flags Enumeration (enum <dfn enum>SessionFlags</dfn>) ## {#enum-SessionFlags}

The [=session_flags=] field must be interpreted in the following way:

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-SessionFlags" id="SessionFlags">
    : <dfn noexport>SESSION_REVERSE_SIGNAL_READY</dfn> = <i>0x1</i>
      :: Indicates session is capable and ready to receive [[#reverse-signalling]] packets.
</div>

Implementations can test the first 4 bytes to detect a [TITLE] stream.

The LDPC data is, like for all packets, allowed to be ignored by receivers.


## Time synchronization ## {#time-synchronization-packets}

Time synchronization packets are optional dual-purpose packets which signal:

 - A context for all timestamps in all streams, using a field called [=epoch=], which denotes an absolute basis in time, to allow for optional receiver synchronization.
 - A device clock counter ([=ts_clock_seq=]) and clock frequency ([=ts_clock_freq=]), to allow for accurate clock cycle synchronization of packet timestamps, stream synchronization, and to enable clock drift and jitter compensation.

The structure of the data in a [[#time-synchronization-packets]] packet is as follows:

<figure id="table-TimeData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#time-synchronization-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Data</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+0">
            <td><code>b(8)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>time_sync_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>''0x03''</td>
            <td>Indicates this is a time synchronization packet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+1">
            <td><code>b(8)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>ts_clock_id</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Signals the clock ID for this clock.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+2">
            <td><code>u(16)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>ts_clock_hz2</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Value, in multiples of 1/65536 Hz, to be added to [=ts_clock_hz=] to make [=ts_clock_freq=].</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+3">
            <td><code>u(32)</code></td>
            <td>[=global_seq=]</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Monotonically incrementing per-packet global sequence number.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+4">
            <td><code>u(64)</code></td>
            <td>[=epoch=]</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Indicates absolute time, in nanoseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970. [[UNIX-time]]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+5">
            <td><code>u(64)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>ts_clock_seq</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Monotonically incrementing counter, incremented once for each cycle of the device clock, at a rate of [=ts_clock_freq=] per second.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+6">
            <td><code>u(32)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>ts_clock_hz</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Hertz value of the device clock.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0300+7">
            <td><code>b(64)</code></td>
            <td>[=ldpc_288_224=]</td>
            <td>[=LDPC(288, 224)=]</td>
            <td>64-bits of LDPC parity data to correct the previous 224 bits of the packet.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

The <dfn noexport>ts_clock_freq</dfn> field is equal to <code>[=ts_clock_freq=] = [=ts_clock_hz=] + [=ts_clock_hz2=]/65536</code>.
Implementations should prefer to use integer math, and instead have the [=ts_clock_freq=] in increments of 1/65536 Hz.

Note: If [=ts_clock_freq=] is 0, then the sender should be assumed to be relying entirely on its real-time clock.

The field defines a strictly monotonic clock signal with a rate of [=ts_clock_freq=], which atomically increments a counter,
[=ts_clock_seq=] on the <b>rising</b> edge of the waveform.

To interpret the clock, read the [[#jitter-compensation]] section. Senders should send time synchronization
packets as often as necessary to prevent clock drift and jitter.

In case of a zero [=ts_clock_hz=], the sender must be assumed to not provide a clock signal reference, and the timestamps
MUST be interpreted as being, in the receiver's understanding, realtime.

The [=epoch=] is a global, <i>optional</i> field that receivers may interpret.<br/>
The [=epoch=] value must not change between packets.<br/>
The [=epoch=] is an absolute starting point, for all timestamps in
all streams, in nanoseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 ([[UNIX-time]]).

The possible applications of the [=epoch=] field are described in the [[#epoch-definition]] section.


## Stream registration ## {#stream-registration-packets}

This packet is used to signal stream registration.

The layout of the data is as follows:

<figure id="table-StreamRegisterData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#stream-registration-packets">
        <tr>

This packet may be sent for an already-initialized stream. The [=bandwidth=] field
and the [=stream_flags=] fields may change, however the [=codec_id=], [=timebase=]
AND [=related_stream_id=] fields must remain the same. If the latter are to change
an [[#end-of-stream-packets]] packet must be sent first.

The [=skip_preroll=] field is a duration <b>in timebase units</b> to signal how much to skip
after reinitializing or seeking. The duration of negative timestamps at the start of streams
must be at least as long as the [=skip_preroll=].


### Stream Init Packets Enumeration (enum <dfn enum>StreamInitPackets</dfn>) ### {#enum-StreamInitPackets}

The [=init_packets=] field indicates which packets are required, and will be transmitted,
for the stream to be correctly decoded and presented. It MUST be interpreted as follows:

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-StreamInitPackets" id="StreamInitPackets">
    : <dfn noexport>STREAM_INIT_PKT_METADATA</dfn> = <i>0x1</i>
      :: Stream requires a [[#metadata-packets]] packet in order to be fully initialized.

    : <dfn noexport>STREAM_INIT_PKT_STREAM_DURATION</dfn> = <i>0x2</i>
      :: Stream requires a [[#stream-duration-packets]] packet in order to be fully initialized.

    : <dfn noexport>STREAM_INIT_PKT_CONFIG_DATA</dfn> = <i>0x4</i>
      :: Stream requires a [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet in order to be fully initialized.

      :: Stream requires a [[#lut-icc-profile-packets]] packet in order to be fully initialized.

    : <dfn noexport>STREAM_INIT_PKT_FONT_DATA</dfn> = <i>0x20</i>
      :: Stream requires a [[#font-data-packets]] packet in order to be fully initialized.
</div>

Implementations MUST wait to parse the packets signalled before exposing the
new stream and decoding/presenting packets from it.


### Stream Flags Enumeration (enum <dfn enum>StreamFlags</dfn>) ### {#enum-StreamFlags}

The [=stream_flag=] field provides context for the stream. It MUST be interpreted
in the following manner:

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-StreamFlags" id="StreamFlags">
    :  <dfn noexport>STREAM_SUBTITLES</dfn> = <i>0x1</i>
      :: Stream contains timed text.

      :: Stream contains non-diegetic audio.

          Note: If [=related_stream_id=] is not equal to [=stream_id=], both should be mixed in.

</div>

Several streams can be <b>chained</b> with the {{SESSION_LOW_QUALITY}} bit set to indicate
progressively lower quality/bitrate versions of the same stream. The very first
stream in the chain MUST NOT have bit {{SESSION_LOW_QUALITY}} set.

Sparse thumbnail streams may exactly match chapters from [=related_stream_id=],
but could be sparser or more frequent.

If bits {{STREAM_COVER_ART}}, {{STREAM_DUB}}, {{STREAM_COMMENTARY}}, {{STREAM_LYRICS}},
{{STREAM_KARAOKE}}, {{STREAM_HEARING_IMPAIRED}} are all unset, then
[=related_stream_id=] must match [=stream_id=], otherwise the stream with a
related <i>different</i> ID must exist.


## Generic data ## {#generic-data-packets}

To ease parsing, the specification defines a common template for data that
requires no special treatment, but only differ by [=descriptor=].

This way, <i>any</i> generic data can share a common code path, have parity data and be a part
of an [[#fec-grouping-packets]] packet.

The following template shall be used for generic data packets:

<figure id="table-GenericData" class="table">

### Generic data segmentation ### {#generic-data-segment-packets}

In case the data needs to be segmented, the following template
has to be used for segments that follow the above:

<figure id="table-GenericDataSegment" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#generic-data-segment-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="GenericDataSegment+0">

            <td><dfn noexport>generic_segment_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>as specified</td>
            <td>Indicates the segment type. Defined in later sections along with [=generic_data_descriptor=].</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="GenericDataSegment+1">

            <td></td>
            <td>The sequence number of the starting [[#generic-data-packets]] packet.</td>
        </tr>

            <td><dfn noexport>seg_offset</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>The offset since the start of the data where the segment starts.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="GenericDataSegment+6">

            <td>payload</td>
            <td>The data for the segment.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

If the data in a [[#generic-data-packets]] packet is to be segmented, it will have
a different descriptor. The [=generic_segment_descriptor=] shall
be different for segments that finalize the data.

The [=header_7=] field can be used to reconstruct the header of the very first
packet in order to determine the timestamps and data type.

Note: Segments are <b>forbidden</b> from partially overlapping. Each segment's offset
and size must either completely overlap with another segment (such as when retransmitting
lost packets), or must fit in between two segments perfectly.


### Generic data parity ### {#generic-data-parity-packets}

Finally, in case the data requires parity data (FEC, but only on the current packet),
the following [[#generic-data-packets]] structure is to be used:

<figure id="table-GenericDataParity" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#generic-data-parity-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>

        </tr>
        <tr id="GenericDataParity+0">

            <td>Indicates this packet carries parity. Defined in later sections along with [=generic_data_descriptor=].</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="GenericDataParity+1">
            <td><code>b(16)</code></td>
            <td>[=stream_id=]</td>

        </tr>
        <tr id="GenericDataParity+6">

            <td><code>b(64)</code></td>
            <td>[=ldpc_288_224=]</td>
            <td>[=LDPC(288, 224)=]</td>
            <td>64-bits of LDPC parity data to correct the previous 224 bits of the packet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="GenericDataParity+9">

            <td>The RaptorQ parity data that can be used to check or correct the previous data packet's payload.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

The data in an parity packet MUST be systematic RaptorQ, as per [[RFC6330]].<br/>
Common FEC Object Transmission Information (OTI) format and Scheme-Specific FEC
Object Transmission Information as described in the document are <i>never</i> used.

The FEC symbol size MUST be 32-bits.

The [=header_7=] field can be used to reconstruct the header of the very first
packet in order to determine the timestamps and data type.


## Stream configuration ## {#stream-configuration-packets}

Codecs generally require a one-off special piece of data needed to initialize them.

To provide this data to receivers, the templates defined in the  MUST be used,
with the following descriptors:

<figure id="table-StreamConfiguration" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#stream-configuration-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Descriptor value</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Structure</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0003+0">
            <td>''0x0003''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>stream_config_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-packets]]</td>
            <td>Codec initialization data.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0004+0">
            <td>''0x0004''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>stream_config_segment_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-segment-packets]]</td>
            <td>Non-final segment for segmented codec configuration.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0005+0">
            <td>''0x0005''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>stream_config_parity_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-parity-packets]]</td>
            <td>Parity data for codec configuration data.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

For more information on the layout of the specific data, consult the
[[#codec-encapsulation]] addendum.

However, in general, the data follows the same layout as what
[[FFmpeg]]'s ''libavcodec'' produces and requires.

An implementation may error out in case it cannot handle the data in the payload.
If so, when reading a file, it must stop, otherwise in a live scenario,
it must send an '''unsupported'' [[#session-control-data-packets]] packet, if such a
connection is open.


## Stream Data ## {#stream-data-packets}

The data packets indicate the start of a stream packet, which may be fragmented into
more [[#stream-data-segment-packets]]. It is laid out as follows:

### Stream data segmentation ### {#stream-data-segment-packets}

Packets can be split up into separate chunks that may be received out of order
and assembled. This allows transmission over switched networks with a limited MTU,
or prevents very large packets from one stream interfering with another stream.
The packet structure used for segments is the [[#generic-data-segment-packets]] from
[[#generic-data-packets]], with the following descriptors:

<figure id="table-StreamDataSegmentation" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#stream-data-segment-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Descriptor value</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Structure</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x00FF+0">
            <td>''0x00FF''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>stream_data_segment_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-segment-packets]]</td>
            <td>Non-final segment for segmented codec configuration.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

The size of the final assembled packet is the sum of all [=seg_length=] fields,
plus the [=data_length=] field from the [[#stream-data-packets]].

Data segments and packets may arrive out of order and be duplicated.
Implementations must reorder them, deduplicate them and assemble them into
complete packets.

Implementations may try to decode incomplete data packets with missing segments
due to latency concerns.

Senders may send duplicate segments to compensate for packet loss,
but should use [[#fec-grouping-packets]] or [[#stream-data-parity-packets]] instead.

Implementations should discard any packets and segments that arrive after their
presentation time. Implementations should drop any packets and segments
that arrive with unrealistically far away presentation times.


## FEC grouping ## {#fec-grouping-packets}

Whilst it's possible to send uncontextualized FEC data backing individual
packets, for most applications, this is only feasible for very high bitrate
single streams, as modern FEC algorithms are highly optimized for packet erasure
recovery.

FEC grouping allows for multiple buffered packets and segments from multiple
streams to be FEC corrected in order to ensure no stream is starved of data.

FEC grouped streams must be registered first via a special packet:

</figure>

It is hightly recommended that the common OTI parameters never change once transmitted.
This lets implementations attempt to apply FEC if they miss a [[#fec-grouping-packets]] packet.

The [=fec_scheme_oti=] field must be interpreted as the following, given in [[RFC6330#section-3.3.3]]:

All streams in an FEC group must have timestamps that cover the same period
of time.

A stream may only be part of a single FEC group at any one time. Sending
a new grouping that includes an already grouped stream will destroy the
previous grouping.

To end a grouping prematurely, one can send an end of stream packet with the group's ID.

FEC groups use a different packet for the FEC data.

The <dfn noexport>fec_source</dfn> data is defined as follows:

### FEC Group Source ### {#struct-FECSource}

<figure id="table-FECSource" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#struct-FECSource">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td><dfn noexport>fec_source_seq</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Indicates a single packet's [=global_seq=] which is to be backed by this FEC group.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>u(16)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>fec_source_blk</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Indicates the FEC source block to which the signaled packet belongs to.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>u(16)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>fec_symbol_id</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Indicates the symbol ID of the packet for the source block.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

Each [[#struct-FECSource]] structure MUST reference a valid packet, in transmission order.
If there are no more valid packets to reference, the sender must start repeating from the very first FEC source.

To perform FEC, first, concatenate each packet (header and payload) referenced into each source block,
in order of the source symbol ID.
Then, perform the procedure to apply FEC as described by [[RFC6330#section-4.4.1]].


## Stream data parity ## {#stream-data-parity-packets}

Stream data packets and segments may individually be backed by data packets.
The structure used for segments follows the [[#generic-data-parity-packets]] template
from the [[#generic-data-packets]] section, with the following descriptor:

<figure id="table-StreamDataParity" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#stream-data-parity-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Descriptor value</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Structure</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x00FE+0">
            <td>''0x00FE''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>stream_data_parity_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-parity-packets]]</td>
            <td>Parity data segment for individual stream data packets.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

Implementations may discard the FEC data, or may delay the previous packet's
decoding to correct it with the FEC data, or may attempt to decode the uncorrected
packet data, and if failed, retry with the corrected data packet.

The data in an FEC packet must be RaptorQ, as per [[RFC6330]].
The symbol size must be 32-bits.

The same lifetime and duplication rules apply for parity packets as they do for
regular data segments.


## Hash packets ## {#hash-packets}

For some <i>niche</i> cases, AVTransport provides the ability to signal a hash for the packet.
This is purely optional for both senders and receivers to signal and interpret.

Note: most filesystems, interfaces and protocols provide a CRC.
      While this hash is much more resistant to bitflips and secure,
      it is recommended to use this in cases like long-term archival,
      or raw RF links (to avoid retransmissions for corrupt packets).

The hash cover exactly <b>one</b> payload-carrying packet's payload.

The hashing algorithm used is [[XXHASH]], with a length of <b>128-bits</b>
(referred to as [[XXHASH#xxh3-algorithm-overview|XXH128]] by the authors).

If present in an AVTransport stream, this packet should be sent before the
[=hash_target=] packet is transmitted.

Demuxers are not required to process this packet or verify that the target
packet's data is received correctly, but they should.


## Index ## {#index-packets}

The index packet contains available byte offsets of nearby keyframes, reconfiguration packets
or metadata changes, and the distance to the next index packet.

</figure>

If index packets are present, an index packet must be sent for any stream
reconfiguration packets, or metadata changes. No future index packets must be signalled
or sent, until all the packets needed to correctly reinitialize streams have been sent.
The exception to this is if a newer reinitialization has begun.

If valid, [=prev_idx=], [=next_idx=] and [=pkt_offset=] offsets must point to the start of
a packet. In other words, the byte pointed to by the offsets must contain the
first, most significant byte of the descriptor of the pointed packet.

If [=stream_id=] is ''0xFFFF'', the timebase used for [=pts=] must be assumed to be
<b>1 nanosecond</b>, numerator of ''1'', denominator of ''1000000000''.

When streaming, [=prev_idx=] and [=next_idx=] must be ''0''.


### Index entry (struct <dfn noexport>IndexEntry</dfn>) ### {#index-entry-struct}

The structure of the data for each index entry is as follows:

<figure id="table-IndexEntryData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#index-entry-struct">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Data</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="IndexEntry+0">
            <td><code>b(16)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>index_entry_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>[[#packet-descriptor|Descriptor]] of the packet that each index points to.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="IndexEntry+1">
            <td><code>i(64)</code></td>
            <td>[=pts=]</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Timestamp of the packet that the index entry points to.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="IndexEntry+2">
            <td><code>u(32)</code></td>
            <td>[=target_seq=]</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Sequence number of the packet pointed to by this index entry.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="IndexEntry+3">
            <td><code>i(32)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>pkt_offset</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>The offset of the index entry relative to the current position in bytes. May be ''0'' if unavailable or not applicable.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

Note: If a packet starts before the value of [=pts=] but has a duration that
matches or exceeds the PTS, then it must be included. This is to permit
correct subtitle presentation, or long duration still pictures like slideshows.


## Metadata ## {#metadata-packets}

The metadata packets can be sent for the overall session, or for a specific
`stream_id` substream. The data is contained in structures templated in the
[[#generic-data-packets]] structures, with the following descriptors:

<figure id="table-Metadata" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#metadata-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Descriptor value</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Structure</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x000A+0">
            <td>''0x000A''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>metadata_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-packets]]</td>
            <td>First metadata segment.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x000B+0">
            <td>''0x000B''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>metadata_segment_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-segment-packets]]</td>
            <td>Final segment of segmented metadata.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x000C+0">
            <td>''0x000C''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>metadata_parity_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-parity-packets]]</td>
            <td>Parity data for metadata.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

The actual metadata must be stored using CBOR, as standardized in [[RFC8949]].

### Common Metadata Keys ### {#enum-CommonMetadataKeys}

The following string keys should be used:

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-CommonMetadataKeys">
    : <dfn noexport>title</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Full name of the stream.
    : <dfn noexport>language</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Language name subtag, as per [[bcp47]].
    : <dfn noexport>language_tag</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: More concise language information, including regional variants, as defined by [[RFC5646#section-2.1]].
    : <dfn noexport>date</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Date of release. MUST be formatted according to [[RFC3339]].
    : <dfn noexport>track</dfn> — ''unsigned integer''
      :: Track number, if the stream is part of an album.
    : <dfn noexport>tracks</dfn> — ''unsigned integer''
      :: Total number of tracks, if stream is part of an album.
    : <dfn noexport>artist</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Full name of the performing artist on this track.
    : <dfn noexport>album_artist</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Full name of the album's artist.
    : <dfn noexport>album</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Full name of the album.
    : <dfn noexport>comment</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Arbitrary release details.
    : <dfn noexport>disc</dfn> — ''unsigned integer''
      :: Disc number, in case of multi-disc releases.
    : <dfn noexport>discs</dfn> — ''unsigned integer''
      :: Total number of discs, in case of multi-disc releases.
    : <dfn noexport>media_type</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Original media type of the release.
    : <dfn noexport>isrc</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: International Standard Recording Code of the given track.
    : <dfn noexport>mcn</dfn> — ''text string''
      :: Media Catalog Number for the album, if available.
</div>

Implementations are free to insert any other tags.

Each name key can be encountered multiple times. Implementations must
discard the old value associated with the key and update the metadata.

If [=stream_id=] is equal to ''0xFFFF'', the metadata applies for the session as a whole.

If [=stream_id=] is not ''0xFFFF'', the metadata is a separate set of values that just
describe a single stream. Tags from other streams, or the general file
metadata must not overwrite each other.

Metadata can be updated by sending new metadata packets with new values.

The {{language}} field must be formatted as a <b>subtag</b>, according to the [[bcp47]].

The {{language_tag}} field must be formatted as described in [[RFC5646#section-2.1]].
It provides more detailed information than the {{language}} field,
including regional variation and script.

The {{date}} field must be formatted according to [[RFC3339]].

Metadata may be padded by appending zeroed bytes to the end. This must
be accounted by the payload value. Implementations may do this to write
metadata after starting and outputting a packet.


## LUT/ICC profile ## {#lut-icc-profile-packets}

Embedding of color lookup tables (LUTs) and ICC profiles for accurate color reproduction is supported.<br/>
The following structure MUST be followed:

<figure id="table-LUTData" class="table">

            <td>The LUT/ICC profile data</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

Often, LUT/ICC profiles may be too large to fit, hence they can be segmented
in the same way as data packets, as well as have parity data. The syntax for
segmentation and parity packets is via the following [[#generic-data-packets]] templates:

<figure id="table-LUTGenericData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#lut-icc-profile-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Descriptor value</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Structure</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0011+0">
            <td>''0x0011''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>lut_icc_segment_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-segment-packets]]</td>
            <td>Non-final segment for segmented LUT/ICC profile.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x0012+0">
            <td>''0x0012''</td>
            <td><dfn noexport>lut_icc_parity_descriptor</dfn></td>
            <td>[[#generic-data-segment-packets]]</td>
            <td>Final segment of a segmented LUT/ICC profile.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>


## LUT/ICC Profile Flags Enumeration (enum <dfn enum>LutFlags</dfn>) ## {#enum-LutFlags}

The [=lut_flags=] field must be interpreted in the following way:

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-LutFlags" id="LutFlags">
    : <dfn noexport>CLUT_SEGMENTED</dfn> = <i>0x1</i>
      :: Indicates that tata contains an incomplete part of a LUT/ICC profile, and requires additional segment packets to complete.
</div>


## LUT/ICC Profile Type Enumeration (enum <dfn enum>LutType</dfn>) ## {#enum-LutType}

The [=lut_type=] field must be interpreted in the following way:

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-LutType" id="LutType">
    : <dfn noexport>CLUT_TYPE_ICC_PROFILE</dfn> = <i>0x1</i>
      :: Indicates that the data contains a regular ICC profile, with version <code>[=lut_major_ver=].[=lut_minor_ver=]</code>.
    : <dfn noexport>CLUT_TYPE_ADOBE_CUBE</dfn> = <i>0x2</i>
      :: Indicates that the data contains an Adobe [[CUBE]] file.
</div>

Note: Lookup tables and ICC profiles must take precedence over the primaries and transfer
characteristics values in [[#video-information-packets]]. The matrix coefficients are still
required for RGB conversion.

Note: Both an ICC profile and a color lookup table may be applied for a single stream.


## Font data ## {#font-data-packets}

Subtitles may often require custom fonts. AVTransport supports embedding of fonts
for use by subtitles.<br/>

Currently, this only applies for ASS streams ([[#ass-encapsulation]]). Once parsed,
these fonts must be made available for the ASS stream.

The following structure MUST be followed:

<figure id="table-FontData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#font-data-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>

            <td>[=stream_id=]</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>
                The stream ID for which to make the font available.

                Note: May be set to ''0xffff'' to make the font available for all streams.

Font data can too be segmented in the same way as data packets, as well as have parity data.
The syntax for segmentation and parity packets is via the following [[#generic-data-packets]]
templates:

[=reflection=] must be applied first, before [=rotation=].

The actual rotation in radians is given by <code>π * ([=rotation=].num/[=rotation=].den)</code>.

Rotation should be applied after all other transformations have been performed on the image,
including cropping via the [=cropped_width=]/[=cropped_height=] fields in
[[#video-information-packets]] packets.

If the value of [=total_duration=] is 0, the entire packet must be ignored.
In such cases, implementations are free to attempt to measure stream duration
via other methods.<br/>
This makes it possible to write stream duration packets at the start of
streams, and amend them later.

The duration must be the total amount of time the stream will be presented.<br/>
Any negative duration MUST be excluded.

The duration must be treated as metadata rather than a hard limit.


## End of stream ## {#end-of-stream-packets}

The EOS packet is laid out as follows:

<figure id="table-EOS" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#end-of-stream-packets">

        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

The [=stream_id=] field may be used to indicate that a specific stream will no longer
receive any packets, and implementations are free to unload decoding and free up
any used resources.

The [=stream_id=] may be reused afterwards, but this is not recommended.

If not encountered in a stream, and the connection was cut, then the receiver is
allowed to gracefully wait for a reconnection.

If encountered in a file, the implementation may regard any data present afterwards
as padding and ignore it. AVTransport files should not be concatenated.

## Codec encapsulation ## {#codec-encapsulation}

The following section lists the supported codecs, along with their encapsulation
definitions. Below, a mapping between [=codec_id=] and encapsulation is listed:

</figure>

The meaning of each field is defined by [[RFC7845]].

Implementations must not use the [=opus_prepad=] field, but must set the
first stream packet's [=pts=] value to a negative value as defined in
[[#negative-times]] to remove the required number of prepended samples.

The [=packet_data=] MUST contain regular Opus packets with their front uncompressed
header intact.

In case of multiple channels, the packets MUST contain the concatenated contents
in coding order of all channels' packets.

In case the Opus bitstream contains native Opus FEC data, the FEC data must be
appended to the packet as-is, and no [[#stream-data-parity-packets]] packets must
be present for this stream.


### AAC encapsulation ### {#aac-encapsulation}

For AAC encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
MUST be 0x41414300 (''AAC0'').

The [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet payload must be the
codec's ''AudioSpecificConfig'', as defined in MPEG-4.

The [=packet_data=] MUST contain regular AAC ADTS packtes. Note that ''LATM'' is
explicitly unsupported.

Implementations must set the first stream packet's ''pts'' value to a negative
value as defined in [[#stream-data-packets]] to remove the required number
of prepended samples.


### AC-3 encapsulation ### {#ac-3-encapsulation}

For AAC encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x41432d33'' (''AC-3'').

AC-3 streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

THe `packet_data` must contain regular AC-3 or E-AC-3 frames, starting from the
`syncinfo` header defined in the specifications.

### ATRAC-1 encapsulation ### {#atrac1-encapsulation}

For ATRAC1, the [=codec_id=] in the
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x41545231'' (''ATR1'').

ATRAC-1 streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

The `packet_data` must contain regular ATRAC-1 frames,
as contained in RIFF.


### ATRAC-9 encapsulation ### {#atrac9-encapsulation}

For ATRAC9, the [=codec_id=] in the
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x41545239'' (''ATR9'').

The payload in [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets
must be laid out in the following way:

            <td>ATRAC-9 block alignment value for each frame. Must be larger than the largest frame in the stream.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

Note: [=atrac9_block_align=] is a value carried over from RIFF encapsulation, and is normally given to
decoders via a separate mechanism. The configuration data length should omit it (so that it's 12 bytes long).

The [=packet_data=] must contain raw ATRAC-9 frames, with no RIFF headers or encapsulation.


### TAK encapsulation ### {#tak-encapsulation}

For TAK (Tom's lossless Audio Kompressor) encapsulation,
the [=codec_id=] in [[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x4154414b'' (''ATAK'').

For FLAC encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x664c6143'' (''fLaC'').

FLAC streams require [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets,

        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

The `packet_data` must contain raw FLAC frames, with their frame header untouched.


### Theora encapsulation ### {#theora-encapsulation}

For Xiph Theora encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]] must be 0x56503332 (''VP32'').

Stream configuration data is required for Theora. [[#stream-configuration-packets]]
packets must contain an <i>"Identification Header"</i> (defined in <b>Section 6.2</b>),
<i>"Comment Header"</i> (defined in <b>Section 6.3</b>), and a <i>"Setup Header"</i>
(defined in <b>Section 6.4</b>), concatenated together, as defined in
<b>Section 3.2.1</b>, <i>"Decoder Setup"</i>.

The [=packet_data=] must contain raw Theora packets.


### VP9 encapsulation ### {#vp9-encapsulation}

For VP9 encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x56503039'' (''VP09'').

The [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet payload must be the
codec's so-called ''uncompressed header''. For information on its syntax,
consult the specifications, section ''6.2 Uncompressed header syntax''.

The [=packet_data=] must contain raw <b>superframe</b> packets, as defined in ''Annex B'' of the
VP9 specifications.


### AV1 encapsulation ### {#av1-encapsulation}

For [[AV1]] encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x41563031'' (<code>AV01</code>).

The [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet payload must be the
codec's so-called ''uncompressed header''. For information on its syntax,
consult the specifications, section ''5.9.2. Uncompressed header syntax''.

### H264 encapsulation ### {#h264-encapsulation}

For H264 encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x48323634'' (''H264'').

The [=packet_data=] must contain the following elements, in order:
 - A single <code>b(64)</code> element with the [=dts=], the time, which indicates when a frame should be input into a synchronous 1-in-1-out decoder.
 - ''Annex-B'' formatted NAL units, with startcode emulation bits included.

A [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet may be sent, to speed up stream initialization.
If they are present, they must contain an ''AVCDecoderConfigurationRecord'' structure,
as defined in ''ISO/IEC 14496-15''.

In-band parameters are always required to be present, even if an ''AVCDecoderConfigurationRecord''
structure is present in a [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet.

Note: On some decoder implementations, giving an ''AVCDecoderConfigurationRecord'' structure upon
initialization will result in the decoder mistaking the packets in the payload as <b>AVCC</b>
rather than <b>Annex-B</b>. Implementations should consider whether the decoder being used will
accept configuration data without assuming Annex-B, and only input such data if it is safe to do so.


### H265 encapsulation ### {#h265-encapsulation}

For H265 encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x48323635'' (''H265'').

The [=packet_data=] must contain the following elements, in order:
 - A single <code>b(64)</code> element with the [=dts=], the time, which indicates when a frame should be input into a synchronous 1-in-1-out decoder.
 - ''Annex-B'' formatted NAL units, with startcode emulation bits included.

''Annex-B'' formatted packets must be used, with startcode emulation bits included.

A [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet may be sent, to
speed up stream initialization. If they are present, they must contain an
''HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord'' structure, as defined in ''ISO/IEC 23008''.


### Dirac/VC-2 encapsulation ### {#dirac-vc-2-encapsulation}

For Dirac or VC-2 encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]

[[#stream-registration-packets]]
MUST be ''0x46467631'' (''FFv1'').

Stream configuration data is required for FFv1. [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets
must contain a "Parameters" structure, as defined in [[RFC9043#name-parameters]].

The [=packet_data=] must contain raw FFv1 packets.


### ProRes encapsulation ### {#prores-encapsulation}

Apple ProRes is a collection of different profiles, each having its own codec ID:

<figure id="table-ProResCodec" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#prores-encapsulation">
        <tr>
            <th>codec ID</th>

            <td>''aprn''</td>
            <td>Apple ProRes RAW Standard Definition</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

All Apple ProRes streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

The [=packet_data=] must contain raw ProRes packets.


### ASS encapsulation ### {#ass-encapsulation}

For ASS encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
MUST be ''0x41535334'' (''ASS4'').

ASS is a popular subtitle format with great presentation capabilities.
Although it was not designed to be streamed or packetized, doing so is possible
with the following specifications.
These match to how Matroska handles [[MATROSKA-ASS]] encapsulation.

ASS contains 3 important sections:
 - Script information, in <code>[Script Info]</code>
 - Styles, in <code>[V4 Styles]</code>
 - Events, in <code>[Events]</code>
 - All other sections MUST be stripped.

First, all data MUST be converted to UTF-8.<br/>

The [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packet payload MUST contain
the <code>[Script Info]</code> and <code>[V4 Styles]</code> sections as a string, unmodified.

Events listed in ASS files MUST be modified in the following way:
 - Start and end timestamps, stored in the <code>Marked</code> field, must be mapped to the packet's [=pts=], [=dts=] and [=duration=] fields, and must be ommitted from the data.
 - All other fields MUST be stored in the [=packet_data=] field as a string, in the followin order: <code>ReadOrder, Layer, Style, Name, MarginL, MarginR, MarginV, Effect, Text</code>.
 - Comments MAY be left as-is after all the fields.

The <code>ReadOrder</code> field is a monotonically incrementing field to identify the correct
order in which to reconstruct the original ASS file.

Multiple packets with the same [=pts=] are permitted.


### SubRip encapsulation ### {#srt-encapsulation}

For SubRip encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
MUST be ''0x53554252'' (''SUBR'').

SubRip are a simple method of subtitle packaging that
are de-facto standardized by the following syntax:

<pre>
1
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,375
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,501
Very good, Lieutenant.
</pre>

Each line starts with the sequence number (1), a start timestamp (2),
an ending timestamp (3), the line(s) themselves, separated by newlines (4),
and finally a blank like to indicate the end of the current line (5).

To encapsulate SubRip subtitles into AVTransport, simply
use the subtitle body (3) as the [=packet_data=].
The start time is the packet's [=pts=] field, while the [=duration=]
field is the difference between the ending timestamp (3) and the
starting timestamp (2).

SubRip streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

Note: Extensions to SubRip files exist, with adding HTML-like tags
      to serve as markup. Dealing with them, however, is the users's
      responsibility. It is recommended to convert such subtitles
      to [[#ass-encapsulation]].

Note: All kinds of encodings and line endings are used in SubRip files.
      They must be converted to UTF-8, with ''\n'' line endings.


### WebVTT encapsulation ### {#webvtt-encapsulation}

For SubRip encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
MUST be ''0x57565454'' (''WVTT'').

[[WEBVTT]] is a patent-free subtitle codec developed by the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It is essentially a standardized
extension of [[#srt-encapsulation|SRT]] subtitles.

Unlike SRT, WebVTT supports styling. This is done via WebVTT
styling blocks, inserted just before the first subtitle line.

The syling data, starting from and including the ''WEBVTT'' identifier,
and ending at just before the first subtitle cue, must be put into
[[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.
Any NOTE comments present before the first cue must be included
alongside, in the way they appear, into the
[[#stream-configuration-packets]] data.

The [=packet_data=] must contain the following structure:

<figure id="table-WebVTTData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#webvtt-encapsulation">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="WebVTT+0">
            <td><code>u(32)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>cue_components_len</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Length of the cue components.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="WebVTT+1">
            <td><code>[=cue_components_len=]*b(8)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>cue_comenents</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>A string with all cue components</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="WebVTT+2">
            <td><code>([=data_length=] - [=cue_components_len=] - 1)*u(8)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>cue_data</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>The actual line of text to present.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

After the timestamp for each cue (line), WebVTT allows a number
of cue components to style the line, terminated by a newline.
As they are not part of the line, they are separated, and provided
upfront as [=cue_comenents=]. The line ending may be retained for
the [=cue_components=], allowing for direct copy of the cue data.

The timestamps for each cue are translated into a [=pts=] and
[=duration=], as with SubRip.


### DNG/TIFF encapsulation ### {#dng-tiff-encapsulation}

For DNG/TIFF encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x54494646'' (''TIFF'').

DNG/TIFF streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets

The [=packet_data=] must contain a raw TIFF file,
with one packet being a single picture.


### JPEG encapsulation ### {#jpeg-encapsulation}

For JPEG and Motion JPEG, the [=codec_id=] in the
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x4a504547'' (''JPEG'').

JPEG and Motion JPEG streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

The [=packet_data=] must contain a raw JPEG file, with
one packet being a single picture.


### JPEG-2000 encapsulation ### {#jpeg2000-encapsulation}

For JPEG-2000 streams, as defined by [[ISO15444]],
the [=codec_id=] in the [[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x4a50324b'' (''JP2K'').

JPEG-2000 streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

The [=packet_data=] must contain a raw JPEG-2000 frame.

The [=packet_data=] must not contain ''JP2'' data (better known as the JPEG-2000
standalone container), but rather the raw, individual JPEG-2000 frames
(known as ''J2K'', or ''HTJ2K'').

High-throughput JPEG-2000, as defined by [[ISO15444-15]],
is supported and recommended. The same considerations as regular
JPEG-2000 apply, but the [=codec_id=] in the [[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x48544a32'' (''HTJ2'') instead.


### PNG encapsulation ### {#png-encapsulation}

For PNG, the [=codec_id=] in the
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
must be ''0x504e4730'' (''PNG0'').

PNG streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

The [=packet_data=] must contain a raw PNG file.
No support for Animated PNG is defined, but simply not
flagging the still picture flag (`stream_flags & 0x04`) and sending
a single picture per frame is sufficient to animate PNG, as this is
allowed for any codec.


### SVG encapsulation ### {#svg-encapsulation}

For [[SVG2]] (Scalable Vector Graphics), the [=codec_id=] in the
[[#stream-registration-packets]] must be ''0x53564732'' (''SVG2'').

SVG streams require no [[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets.

The [=packet_data=] must contain a raw SVG file. Compressed ''SVGZ''
are explicitly not supported. Instead, the [=pkt_compression=] field
must be used if compression is to be used. This is due to DEFLATE
([[RFC1951]]) being potentially a bottleneck in decompression.

No support for animated SVG ([[SVG2#animated-mode]]) is available, or any
SVG variant with ''Javascript'' embedded. Each SVG packet must be a raw and
standalone. Embedded images are, however, <b><i>permitted</i></b>.

The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> dimensions of [[#video-information-packets]]
shall be a <i>suggested</i> dimension, generally set upon creation time.

Note: SVG streams may be either video streams <b>or</b> used as <i>subtitles</i>.
The {{STREAM_SUBTITLES}} flags must be set if the SVG stream is to be used as
subtitles.


### Raw audio encapsulation ### {#raw-audio-encapsulation}

For raw audio encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in
[[#stream-registration-packets]]
MUST be ''0x52414141'' (''RAAA'').

[[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets are required, and
must be laid out in the following way:

<figure id="table-RawAudioConfig" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#raw-audio-encapsulation">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>u(32)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>ra_channels</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>The number of channels contained.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>b(8)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>ra_bits</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>The number of bits for each sample.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>u(8)</code></td>
            <td><dfn noexport>ra_float</dfn></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>If non-zero, data is floating-point.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

The [=packet_data=] must contain the concatenated stream of <b>interleaved</b> samples
for all channels.

The samples must be <b>normalized</b> between <b>[-1.0, 1.0]</b> if they're float, and
full-range <i>signed</i> if they're integers.

The size of each sample must be [=ra_bits=], and must be aligned to the nearest
<b>power of two</b>, with the padding in the <b>least significant bits</b>. That means
that 24-bit samples are coded as 32-bits, with the data contained in the topmost 24 bits.


### Raw video encapsulation ### {#raw-video-encapsulation}

For raw video encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in [[#stream-registration-packets]]
MUST be ''0x52415656'' (''RAVV'').

[[#stream-configuration-packets]] packets are required, and
must be laid out in the following way:

</figure>

The purpose of the [=rc_offset=] field is to allow differentiation between
different orderings of pixels in an RGB video, e.g. ''RGB'''s [=rc_offset=]s will
be <code>[0, 1, 2]</code>, whilst ''BGR'''s will be <code>[2, 1, 0]</code>.
The components MUST be given in the order they appear in the stream.

The [=packet_data=] field MUST contain [=rv_planes=], with each plane having
[=rv_plane_stride=] bytes per line. The number of horizontal lines being given by
[=rv_height=] for plane number ''0'', and <code>[=rv_height=] >> [=rv_ver_subsample=]</code>
for all other planes. The actual lines must be filled in according to [=rc_offset=] and [=rc_stride=].

Note: [[#video-information-packets]] packets must be present. The information in this structure
is only sufficient to parse data, not enough to present it.


## Raw Video Flags Enumeration (enum <dfn enum>RawVideoFlags</dfn>) ## {#enum-RawVideoFlags}

The [=rv_flags=] field must be interpreted in the following way:

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-RawVideoFlags">
    : <dfn noexport>RAW_VIDEO_FLOAT</dfn> = 0x1
      :: Video contains [[IEEE-754]] <b>normalized</b> floating point values. Size is determined by the [=rv_bpp=] value.
    : <dfn noexport>RAW_VIDEO_ALPHA</dfn> = 0x2
      :: Video contains a stright, non-premultiplied alpha. Alpha is always the last component.
    : <dfn noexport>RAW_VIDEO_ALPHA_PREMULTIPLIED</dfn> = 0x4
      :: Video contains a premultiplied alpha channel. Alpha is always the last component.
    : <dfn noexport>RAW_VIDEO_PLANAR</dfn> = 0x8
      :: At least one pixel component is not sharing a plane, e.g. video is <i>planar</i>.
    : <dfn noexport>RAW_VIDEO_BITPACKED</dfn> = 0x10
      :: Video's components are tightly packed, e.g. video is <i>bitpacked</i>.
    : <dfn noexport>RAW_VIDEO_BIG_ENDIAN</dfn> = 0x20
      :: Video's values are <b>big-endian</b>. If unset, values are <i>little-endian</i>.
</div>

Note: [=rv_flags=] must not signal both {{RAW_VIDEO_ALPHA}} and {{RAW_VIDEO_ALPHA_PREMULTIPLIED}}.
Such a combination of flags is undefined.

This structure is flexible enough to permit zero-copy or one-copy streaming
of video from most sources.


### Custom codec encapsulation ### {#custom-codec-encapsulation}

A special section is dedicated for custom codec storage. While potentially useful
for experimentation and for specialized usecases, users of such are invited to submit
an addendum to this document to formalize such containerization. This field MUST NOT be
used if the codec being contained already has a formal definition in this spec.

For custom encapsulation, the [=codec_id=] in [[#stream-registration-packets]] must be
''0x433f****'' (''C?**''), where the bottom 2 bytes can be any value between
''0x30'' to ''0x39'' (<code>0</code> to <code>9</code> in ASCII) and
''0x61'' to ''0x7a'' (<code>a</codE> to <code>z</code> in ASCII).

The [[#stream-configuration-packets]] payload can be any length
and contain any sequence of data.

The [=packet_data=] field can be any length and contain any sequence of data.


## Streaming ## {#streaming}

This section describes and suggests behavior for realtime AVTransport streams.

The protocol supports four different streaming arrangements:
 - Unidirectional (Sender to Receiver)
 - Bidirectional (Sender to Receiver and Receiver to Sender)
 - Multidirectional prompted (Sender to Multiple Active Receivers)
 - Multicast (Sender to Multiple Receivers)

In the first case (Unidirectional), the sender initializes the session by sending a [[#session-start-packets]]
to the receiver, and proceeds with sending more packets.

In the second case (Bidirectional), the sender initializes the session by sending a [[#session-start-packets]]
packet with a {{SESSION_REVERSE_SIGNAL_READY}} flag, and on the same connection, the receiver sends another
[[#session-start-packets]] packet to initialize reverse connectivity.

In the third case (Multidirectional prompted) case, the sender listens for any [[#session-start-packets]]
sent by clients on a given port. If received, the server begins to send information back to the client address
on the same connection it received the session start packet.

In the fourth case (Multicast), the server binds to a multicast UDP address and begins to send data.

In general, implementations should emit the following packet types
at the given frequencies.

        </tr>

        <tr>

            <td>[[#fec-grouping-packets]]</td>

            <td>[[#user-data-packets]]</td>
            <td>As often as necessary</td>
            <td>Optional user data packets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[[#end-of-stream-packets]]</td>
            <td>Once</td>
            <td>Finalizes a stream or session.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

In particular, [[#time-synchronization-packets]] packets should
be sent as often as necessary if timestamp jitter avoidance is a requirement.


### UDP ### {#udp-streaming}

To adapt AVTransport for streaming over [[RFC768|UDP]] is trivial - simply send the data packets
as-is specified, with no changes required. The sender implementation should
resent packets at the frequencies listed in [[#session-start-packets]]
to permit for implementations that didn't catch on the start of the stream begin
decoding.

UDP mode is unidirectional, but the implementations are free to use the
[[#reverse-signalling]] data if they negotiate it themselves.<br/>
Reverse signalling should not be used if the connection is public.

Implementations must segment the data such that the network MTU is never
exceeded and no packet fragmentation occurs.<br/>
The <b>minimum</b> network MTU required for the protocol is <b>384 bytes</b>,
as to allow [[#video-information-packets]] or any future large
packets to be sent without fragmentation.

[[RFC2675|Jumbograms]] may be used where supported to reduce overhead and increase efficiency.

Note: Data packets may be padded by appending zeroed bytes after the [=packet_data=]
field up to the maximum MTU size. This permits constant bitrate operation,
as well as preventing metadata leakage in the form of a packet size.

Note: When operating at higher MTUs, implementations should consider adding FEC or parity,
as the 16-bit UDP datagram CRC may be inadequate to detect errors.

If [[#reverse-signalling]] is used, the receiver must send packets over to the
sender using the same port number that the receiver is listening on.


### UDP-Lite ### {#udp-lite-streaming}

UDP-Lite ([[RFC3828]]) should be preferred to [[RFC768|UDP]], if support for it is
available throughout the network.<br/>
When using UDP-Lite, the same considerations and notes as UDP apply.

As UDP-Lite allows for variable checksum coverage, the <b>minimum</b> checksum
coverage must be used, where only the UDP-Lite header (8 bytes) is checksummed.

Implementations should insert adequate FEC information, and receivers should
correct data with it, as packet integrity guarantees are off.

If [[#reverse-signalling]] is used, same port number an method must
be used for reverse signalling as the sender's.


### QUIC ### {#quic-streaming}

AVTransport tries to use as much of the modern conveniences of [[RFC9000/QUIC]]
as possible. As such, it uses both reliable and unreliable streams, as well
as bidirectionality features of the transport mechanism.

All data packets with descriptors ''0x01**'', ''0xFF'', ''0xFE'', ''0xFD'' and ''0xFC''
must be sent over in an <i>unreliable</i> QUIC datagram stream, as per
[[RFC9221]]. Each stream must map to a different QUIC stream, though their AVTransport
and QUIC stream IDs do not have to match.

All other packets must be sent over a reliable steam. FEC data for those packets
should not be signalled.

Implementations must segment the data such that the network MTU is never
exceeded and no packet fragmentation occurs.

The <b>minimum</b> network MTU required for the protocol is <b>384 bytes</b>,
as to allow [[#video-information-packets]] or any future large packets to be sent
without fragmentation.

The ALPN must contain the extension 0x61, 0x76, 0x74, 0x30 (''avt0'').

Jumbograms may be used where supported to reduce overhead and increase efficiency.

[[#reverse-signalling]] is natively supported on QUIC.


### Packetized networks ### {#packetized-network-streaming}

AVTransport is a series of individual packets with no overarching data structure.
This allows for it to be contained over any protocol or transmitted over any packetized
network.

The built-in resilience in each data structure makes the protocol suitable even over
connections with a high bit error rate.

Poor connection reliability can be largely overcome by using
[[#fec-grouping-packets]].

This specification does not specify how linking or transmission is performed - only
that the AVTransport packets remain compliant with their definition here, and the
stream as a whole remains compliant.


### Serial ### {#serial-transmission}

AVTransport explicitly carries the size of the contained data. This makes it suitable
for not only packetized networks, but also serial links.

Users must track the start of each AVTransport packet themselves, using the packet headers
and, optionally, LDPC data to synchronize with the source.

The specification contains no recommendation on how the data is transported. Users
should, if necessary, use FEC and other reliability features.


## Reverse signalling ## {#reverse-signalling}

AVTransport supports bidirectional connections. Implementing this part of the
specification is fully optional.

<b>All</b> packets send back from a receiver to the transmitter must have bit
''0x8000'' set in their descriptors. This means that the receiver can send back
the same type of packets that the transmitter can, with a number of extra
packets for control.

Receivers must receive a [[#session-start-packets]] packet
from a transmitter, with bit {{SESSION_REVERSE_SIGNAL_READY}} set in the [=session_flags=]
bitmask before they are allowed to send packets back.


### Session control data ### {#session-control-data-packets}

The receiver can use this type to return errors and more to the sender in a
one-to-one transmission. The following syntax is used:

<figure id="table-ControlData" class="table">
    <table class="complex data longlastcol" dfn-for="#session-control-data-packets">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>

            <td>If ''1'', Asks the sender to seek to the position given by [=seek_pts=] and/or [=seek_seq=].</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="0x8001+7">
            <td><code>i(64)</code></td>

            <td>The sequence number of the packet to seek to.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>

If the sender gets such a packet, and either its [=uplink_ip=] or its [=uplink_port=]
do not match, the sender must cease this connection, reopen a new connection
with the given [=uplink_ip=], and resend all packets needed to begin decoding
to the new destination.

The [=seek=] request asks the sender to begin sending old data that is still
available. The sender may not comply if that data suddenly becomes unavailable.
If the value of [=seek=] is equal to ''0'', then the receiver must comply
and always start sending the newest data.

If the [=resend_init=] flag is set to a non-zero value, senders should flush all encoders
such that the receiver can begin decoding as soon as possible.

If operating over QUIC, then any old data must be served
over a <i>reliable</i> stream, as latency isn't critical. If the receiver asks again
for the newsest available data, that data's payload is once again sent over an
*unreliable* stream.

The following error values are allowed:


## Error Code Enumeration (enum <dfn enum>ErrorCode</dfn>) ## {#enum-ErrorCode}

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="#enum-ErrorCode">
    : <dfn noexport>ERROR_CODE_GENERIC</dfn> = <i>0x1</i>
      :: Signals a generic error.
    : <dfn noexport>ERROR_CODE_UNSUPPORTED</dfn> = <i>0x2</i>
      :: Unsupported data. May be sent after the sender sends a [[#stream-registration-packets]] to indicate that the receiver does not support this codec. The sender may send another packet of this type with the same [=stream_id=] to attempt reinitialization with different parameters.
</div>


### Feedback ### {#feedback-packets}

The following packet MAY be sent from the receiver to the sender.

Receivers should send out a new statistics packet every time a count was updated.
Additionally, receivers should send new feedback packets often enough to prevent
UDP NAT from timing out.

            <td>If `1`, asks the sender to not send any packets relating to [=stream_id=] streams.</td>
        </tr>

This can be used to save bandwidth. If previously disabled and then enabled,
all packets necessary to initialize the stream MUST be resent.


## Informative muxer behaviour ## {#informative-muxer-behaviour}

This annex covers recommended practices for muxers, particularly with regards to avoiding stream starvation.


## Informative demuxer behaviour ## {#informative-demuxer-behaviour}

This annex covers recommended practices for demuxers, mainly with packet lifetime,
buffering, and reordering.


# Annex # {#annex}

Additional data or recommendations for the AVTransport specification is listed here.

## Annex G: LDPC ## {#annex-g-ldpc}

This normative annex shall cover the usage and operation of [[LDPC]] within AVTransport.

The LDPC variant to be used is <b>irregular</b> (each row of each matrix has a non-constant
amount of bits set to 1), systematic (parity data is separate from message data), with no subblocks.
The full block, along with the check data, shall be sent to an LDPC decoder.

To ease implementations, only two different lengths are used:
 - <dfn noexport>LDPC(288, 224)</dfn>
     :: 224-bit message, 64-bit parity, rate of <code>7/9</code>, [[#ldpc_h_matrix_288_224_def|H₆₄ₓ₂₈₈-matrix]]
 - <dfn noexport>LDPC(2784, 2016)</dfn>
     :: 2016-bit message, 768-bit parity, rate of <code>21/29</code>, [[#ldpc_h_matrix_2784_2016_def|H₇₆₈ₓ₂₇₈₄-matrix]]

For reference, the following code may be used to compute the LDPC parity data:

<pre highlight=c id="ldpc_encode_fn">
void ldpc_encode(uint8_t *pkt, const uint64_t *H,
                 int message_bits, int parity_bits)
{
    int i, j, k;
    uint64_t parity, data, bits[8];
    uint8_t *dst = &pkt[message_bits / 8]; /* Parity data goes last */

    /* Process 64 rows at a time */
    for (i = 0; i < (parity_bits / 64); i++) {
        parity = 0x0; /* Start with zero parity */

        /* Process 8 data bits at a time */
        for (j = 0; j < (message_bits / 8); j++) {
            data = pkt[j];

            /* Duplicate each bit 64 times (reversed, bytestream order) */
            for (k = 0; k < 8; k++)
                bits[k] = ((data >> (7 - k)) & 1) * UINT64_MAX;

            /* Add each bit to a parity bit, according to the matrix */
            for (k = 0; k < 8; k++)
                parity ^= bits[k] & (*H++);
        }

        /* Write parity data, in bytestream order */
        for (k = 56; k >= 0; k -= 8)
            *dst++ = (parity >> k) & 0xFF;

        /* Skip identity elements in the matrix */
        H += parity_bits;
    }
}
</pre>

This algorithm is quite inefficient, but even 10-year old embedded devices can
do at least 2 million [=LDPC(288, 224)=] encodings per second.

Implementations should consider using more advanced encoding algorithms, such
as the [[LDPC-encoding|Richardson-Urbanke method]] to reduce the overhead further.


### LDPC H-matrices ### {#ldpc-h-matrices}

The following parity-check matrices (<b>H</b>) below shall be used for encoding (via the pseudocode above)
and decoding. Implementations are free to convert them to G matrices and use conventional encoding methods.
The matrices are optimized for AWGN channels, but they will perform nearly as well anywhere else.

As required by LDPC, matrices are of size <code>(n - k) x n</code>, thus:
 - 64x288
 - 768x2784

Note: In standard mathematical notation, matrix sizes are specified as <b>height x width</b>,
not <i>width x height</i>.

The last (n - k) columns contain the identity matrix. Encode-only implementations may omit them
in order to save space.

As each value of a matrix is purely boolean, <b>64 bits in each column are represented as a
64-bit unsigned integers</b>, in big endian format. Therefore, the most significant bit contains
the bit from the top row, and so on. In other words, <b><i>GF(2⁶)</i></b>.
This is the format that the reference function above expects.

The matrices are also listed as standard .alist files, directly usable for analysis and simulations.

     *   packets to the given address. Passive means to wait for receivers to
     *   send packets on the given address to begin transmitting back to them.
     *
     *   For receivers, the default value, passive means to listen on the given
     *   address for any packets received. Active for receivers means that receivers
     *   will actively connect and try to request a stream from the target address.
     *
     * - <address> of the remote host, or local host, or multicast group
     *   May be suffixed with %<interface> to indicate an interface to attempt to bind to.
